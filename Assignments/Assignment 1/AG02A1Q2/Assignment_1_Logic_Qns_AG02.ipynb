But for resolution-refutation, the negation of the query will be add to the list of clauses, and then select two clauses to do the resolution and generate new clause. Since we have 18 variables, the maximum number of clauses it will generate is 3^18(3 situations for every variable in a clause: positive, negative, and non-exist), and for each query that is False, theoretically the number of generated clause will hit the maxium number, but in practice the function will hang, as the clauses generated are too much for the RAM.
